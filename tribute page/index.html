        <p>He joined FC Barcelona's youth academy in 2000 at 13, and just three years later, he made his debut for the first team. In the years that followed, Messi quickly established himself as one of the greatest players of his generation.

        <p>Despite his success on the pitch, Messi has faced numerous challenges throughout his career. He was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child, which required expensive treatment and put a strain on his family's finances.

            In 2021, he won his first major international trophy, guiding Argentina to a Copa America triumph. He helped his country lift their third World Cup title in Qatar a year later.
            
            Off the pitch, Messi is known for his philanthropic work. He has established the Leo Messi Foundation, which aims to improve the lives of children in need worldwide. He has also been involved in numerous charitable initiatives, including a project to build a children's hospital in his hometown of Rosario, Argentina.</p>
